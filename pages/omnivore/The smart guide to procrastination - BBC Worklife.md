## Highlights

> Putting play before work may seem irresponsible, but experts argue that this counterintuitive move might actually make you more productive in the long run. [](https://omnivore.app/me/the-smart-guide-to-procrastination-bbc-worklife-187696d6d2c#4a8df368-a678-4d91-854e-7accab98f8c5)

> Enter ‘unscheduling’: an upside-down approach to help chronic postponers get their lives back on track. Like most time-planning methods, the technique involves creating a weekly schedule that blocks out specific time periods for particular tasks.

> Those of us who finished our dissertations in one to two years as opposed to three to 13 years, we were the ones who were busier in our lives - Fiore [](https://omnivore.app/me/the-smart-guide-to-procrastination-bbc-worklife-187696d6d2c#9624f3d6-49ef-4166-b61e-7eaf27835da3)

> Building some 'unschedule' time in to your week could not only help you be more efficient but healthier [](https://omnivore.app/me/the-smart-guide-to-procrastination-bbc-worklife-187696d6d2c#1668ecae-664f-4738-adac-9702c1116e4e)

> The unschedule works because rather than peering tentatively at your diary and baulking at a sea of dull meetings, overwhelming life admin and intimidating tasks like “write a book”, instead you see a week that you can actually look forward to. It’s about control: rather than cancelling lunches and postponing gym sessions in order to devote yourself completely to a particular project, you can slot it neatly into the life that you want to lead.

> It's safer to blame procrastination for a disappointing result than to feel your best wasn't good enough - Burka [](https://omnivore.app/me/the-smart-guide-to-procrastination-bbc-worklife-187696d6d2c#d951bb1a-4343-4fc4-8517-bffb7fc4671a)

> Instead, you’re asked to begin by focusing on the task in hand for just 15 minutes, because anyone can commit to that amount of time. It’s all about making a start, rather than aiming to finish: this helps to avoid some of the anxieties that people may have about their goals. “This reinforces the idea that progress happens a little bit at a time, not in one Herculean effort,” says Burka.

> Finally, Fiore recommends changing the language that you use to describe your work: rather than saying “I must” or “I have to”, he suggests saying “I choose to”. This reframes your work as something positive, and dissolves the internal battle you might be having between wanting to loll around on the sofa and feeling you need to get to work. “’I am choosing to face something’ – only humans can choose surgery, or choose graduate school, or choose things that are difficult,” he says.
