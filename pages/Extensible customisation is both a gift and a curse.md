# Extensible customisation is both a gift and a curse
## Gift
- Customisation within an application is of course what many power users seek 
- One can tailor any application and make them their own
## Curse
- Procrastination by spending too much time customising the application instead of doing actual work.
	- Every time I am customising Obsidian, I get the "smart" feeling.
	- But I know that I am actually not doing any work...
