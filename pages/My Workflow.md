# My Workflow
## My Outliner workflow
- [[Obsidian vs Logseq]], the war of note-taking applications.
	- The reason I chose Obsidian over Logseq.
- I do not outline (prepend a hyphen) headings of my notes.
- I only outline the contents of the notes.
- It is possible to put a heading within an outline only to emphasis on important content.
- Use `Shift+Enter` to insert admonition and code blocks within bulleted list, to avoid unwanted behaviours.
    - The backticks have to be aligned correctly for the code block to render properly
## My PDF annotation work
- I use the "Annotator" community plugins for that.
- I also what a quick add function: `QuickAdd: Add PDF`
	- Then, running the command, I need to put the exact PDF name for it to generate the annotation markdown file.
	- I first need to download and insert all my PDFs in the `assets/attachments` folder
		- I can even put them in a sub-folder if I want to.
	- The command will also append the link to the file at the cursor position.
