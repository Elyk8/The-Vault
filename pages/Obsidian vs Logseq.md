# Obsidian vs Logseq
- Outlining is what made me tried to use Logseq instead of Obsidian
	- However the editing experience in logseq was not what I was looking for.
- To me, Obsidian has the much better editing experience.
- But Logseq has been great due to the outline feature, and the ease of retrieving information.
	- That is why I finally replicated my Logseq workflow in obsidian.
- I still do think that Logseq is far better for information retrieval, for having everything right in front of you.
